This repository will hold a number of tests and examples of assembly code for
the x86 and x86-64 architectures.

== Building ==

Any code published here should compile and run in modern Linux systems just by
running `make`.

On occasion code could be portable enough (no system calls or other system
dependent functionality) in order for you to run on your Windows box, for
example.
